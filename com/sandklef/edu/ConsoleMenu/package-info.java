/**
 * Simple package to ease up console menus
 *
 * The main purpose is, rather than easing up writing a console menu,
 * to show the use of Interfaces. In the examples we show how to
 * create and add MenuItem classes and also how to add anonymous
 * classes/objects.
 *
 * See package com.sandklef.edu.examples for examples on how to use it.
