#Educational software#

Some sofoftware I've written for use in education.

##ConsoleMenu##

The main purpose is, rather than easing up writing a console menu, to
show the use of Interfaces. In the examples we show how to create and
add MenuItem classes and also how to add anonymous classes/objects.
