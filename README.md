#Educational software and manuals#

... *some sofoftware and manuals I've written for use in education.*





##Java Manuals## 

###Interfaces###


##Java Software## 

###ConsoleMenu###

The main purpose is, rather than easing up writing a console menu, to
show the use of Interfaces and to get students to get to know how GUI
programming with Swing feels like without actually using it. In the
examples we show how to create and add MenuItem classes and also how
to add anonymous MenuItem classes/objects.

   
###MoveMe###

It's just a thought (CCR, ayone? ;) ).... but how about having a
physical exercise in a class of newbies where the students use a very
small language to instruct a student from A to B in a room with tables
as barriers in the way. This software is a very simple software
version of this. See it as a BETA version.

The language consists of:
 * up
 * down
 * left
 * right

with thoughts on adding support for simple iterations....

###koder###

After deep (hrmpfh?) discussions about how to teach Java we've
concluded that the main barrier is that you have to crate a class with
the dreaded main method. With this little piece of demo software you
can skip all that and simply write Java in a window and execute it
with a click - no terminal, no main class, no man method. You can add
classes by adding a pane.
