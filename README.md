... *some sofoftware and manuals I've written for use in education.*





##Java Manuals## 

###Interfaces###


##Java Software## 

###ConsoleMenu###

The main purpose is, rather than easing up writing a console menu, to
show the use of Interfaces and to get students to get to know how GUI
programming with Swing feels like without actually using it. In the
examples we show how to create and add MenuItem classes and also how
to add anonymous MenuItem classes/objects.
