#Educational software and manuals#

... *some sofoftware and manuals I've written for use in education.*

##My Background##

I have been teaching embedded programming using C, Java, about Free
and Open Source Software (I have even taught Software Processes). How
well I did, and still do, I leave to others to say. I really hope I
don't suck too much in general. Too some I am horribly bad and to some
I might even be quite good. I do not write this page thinking I am an
awesome instructor or programmering. I think the main reason I write
this is that I love programming (programming makes my brain feel good)
and I really love seeing students show that smile when they "finally"
get it.

##Pedagocial challenges## 

I and, I believe, many other lecturers/teachers have asked the
question why students today are so different than we were when we
studied. Why don't they spend the time? Why don't they understand
what's good for them?

Sometimes I wonder if I am pedagogical at all. Getting a question like
"why didn't you ever teach us how to use this method" after I've spent
some 3-4 hours on that, be it a week or two earlier, makes me think I
suck at teaching. But I guess you have to look at it from another
angle than thinking that the teacher or the student suck (hey, don't
we all suck? .. I mean really, we all do suck).

*Students don't read the book*

Well, the students don't! Survey after survey tell that the book or
whatever litterature is not. How to overcome this is a tough question. 

*Students can't keep focus for more than a couple of miutes*

This is, in my opinion, nothing new at all. I really paid attention
during network, operating systems and during C courses at univ when I
used to study (90's). So I really don't think the new students areany
different.

BTW: I still haven't finished by database course.

*Students don't pay attention during lectures*

Well, the students don't! How to overcome this? Is lectures the right
tool in the first place?


So, going back to the first questions in this section. Or rather
restating them. Or perhaps even forget about them since the main
question really should be - how do we (teachers) adapt to the younger
generation WITHOUT (and I do mean whithout) sacrifising the goals of
education.

At the university where I work now (2014) we have just started to try
out giving lectures using Flipped Classrom. With no scientifically
proper results I can say that the students apreciate it. Some of the
students have seen my dreaded attempts to pretend to know things
several times. I don't know if it is because they think I am funny
because I am totalyy randomly saying stupid things or if it is because
they want to learn but I am as convinced as one could be without
empirical backing as one could be that this is the right way. Ok, it's
a lot of more work for me as a teacher but the discussion, rather than
me rambling on about one subject for hours, is quite satsifying.

So perhaps Video lectures is the way to go.... so why the fxxk do I
write a book, or pretened to write a book? Well, I dunno to be
honest. Or rather I do know why but I don't know how and what. Hmm, an
explanation is need here. I think we need a new learning artifact,
don't know what and how to do it. However I will give it a shot.

##Pedagogical problems## 

* Students don't read the books/litterature.
* Students have a short attention span ot don't pay attention.

##Pedagogical thought##

*Motivation*. I believe that motivation is the most important thing
here. And I also believe that this is where we (the elder)
misundertand the students of today (the young). We need to motivate
the students - perhaps they are spoilt or perhaps we followed our
teachers blindly. So how do we keep students motivated. Hey, they
don't differ to us. We all like quick results. So instant, or perhaps,
quick gratification is one key.

*Accessible*. Ok, we used to read a lot of books and became quite good
programmers. But was and is books really the way to go? I have become
quite convinced that video lectures with theory and well thought
examples on how to apply it is another key.







##Java Manuals## 

###Interfaces###


##Java Software## 

###ConsoleMenu###

The main purpose is, rather than easing up writing a console menu, to
show the use of Interfaces and to get students to get to know how GUI
programming with Swing feels like without actually using it. In the
examples we show how to create and add MenuItem classes and also how
to add anonymous MenuItem classes/objects.
